    I’m a Data Analytics and Policy Studies double major interested in driving innovation in a field such as sports or environmental work.  
    
    Outside of my academic and athletic pursuits, I love to go hiking and snowboarding, especially on the West Coast as I am a Washington 
    state native. Some of my life goals include backpacking Mt. Rainer and Mt. Hood and potentially hiking the 2653-mile-long Pacific Crest Trail. 
    I love to watercolor and have started knitting a scarf. I have also recently become a co-parent of a 10-year-old tuxedo cat named Mr. Gibbs.
