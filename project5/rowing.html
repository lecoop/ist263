    <h1>Learn more about what rowing and collegiate athletics means to me</h1>
    <p>Rowing is such a big part of my life that it deserves its own page. Here I will walk you through my journey to becoming a college athlete, what a typical day of my life is like, and all the things rowing has taught me that are invaluable to my development as a person.</p>

    <h3>How I got to Syracuse Women's Rowing</h2>
    <p>I played basketball for 10 years before I ever picked up an oar. However, after a poor experience with my high-school basketball coach, I was inspired to try rowing and am eternally grateful that I did. During my junior year of high school after only 2 years of rowing, I was recruited to row at the top 10 rowing school, Syracuse! Rowing has made me into the person I am today and has taught me so many life lessons that I don’t feel listing it on my resume encapsulates. Hence, here are just some of the wonderful things that rowing has taught me and continues to enforce each day.</p>

    <h2>What Rowing has taught me</h2>

            <h3>Time is your most valuable resource</h3>
            <p>At the Division I level, rowers practice for 20 hours a week for most of the fall and spring semester. These 20 hours only include the time in which we are physically at practice, so not the time it takes to get to the boathouse, our recovery and work with our athletic trainers, meetings with coaches, competitions, and races (including their travel) and any extra work you may need to do on your own.  (put in a picture of my schedule from me google Cal here).
                Therefore, rowers are some of the best time-managers ever. With so much time and energy going into your sport, you cannot take preparation lightly. To balance training, racing, a full credit-course load, any extra curriculars, sleep for at least 8 hours, and build in some time to have fun, you quickly realize that time is your most valuable resource. To achieve academic success and not break down, I have honed my time-management skills in a way that I know I would not have been able to without rowing. For example, I am religiously glued to my google calendar, assignment tracker and have employed the life rule of “If it takes less than 5 minutes, do it right away”. While it has been stressful at times, I could not imagine college without this schedule and am grateful for how it has made me adapt and overcome my past bad habits of procrastination. </p></div>

            <h3>Drive and Grit</h3>
            <p> Rowing is one of the hardest sports in terms of pushing yourself physically. You train for months and months all so that you ran row 2000km as fast as possible and come out on top. These countless hours of training all lead up to an around -7minute race and ensuring that those 7 minutes goes well takes focus on every single stroke leading up to it.  On top of this long-term goal setting, in rowing you are attempting to achieve perfection on every single stroke. Rowing is not an inherently difficult movement, but most rowers spend years of their life searching to achieving the perfect stroke and never technically reach that goal. Having the focus to attempt to achieve this goal requires immense determination and tenacity. Rowing has taught me that to achieve a long-term goal, every single decision matters in reaching that goal, even if your race is months away. You need to be so prepared and ahead, that when it comes to race day, your mind can be simple and only think of the task in front of you. </p>

            <h3>Coachability</h3>
            <p>In rowing you are constantly receiving feedback from your coach, coxswain, and teammates but also the oar, the boat, and the water. You can even close your eyes and hear certain sounds and use those to determine if you are not doing something at the same time as the other people in the boat. Receiving so much feedback can either help you or hurt you, and it takes a lot of time and maturity to learn how to effectively consider feedback. Through rowing I have been able to learn how to receive feedback and control my ego. To have a successful program, the athletes need to ensure that they can take feedback and hold the team’s interests above their own. Rowing is also extremely data driven which can be hard to mentally handle. In most sports coaches’ decisions seem to be more subjective however in rowing, the data doesn’t lie and you either made the boat row faster or you slowed it down. Additionally, when we train indoors on the ergometer, every single stroke you take, the erg shows you a number of how fast you are going. While this may not seem that daunting, most rowers can fall into the bad habit of equating their worth to what number they see on the screen. This tie between self-worth and numbers also happens on the water, when the entire team is ranked, and it is very clear who is above one another. When I first started rowing in college, I associated my entire self-worth with where I was ranked or how fast I was able to go on workouts. While it is still easy for myself to fall on these bad habits, I have worked tenaciously to try to break that cycle for myself and with my teammates.</p>

            <h3>Success is not linear</h3>
            <p>One lesson that has taken me so long to learn and one that continues to challenge me is the fact that success is not linear. I have struggled with perfectionism my entire life and only since coming to college and rowing, have I felt like I have finally broken free. From my time here, I have truly learned how success is not linear, and that bumps in the road do not equal catastrophic failure. In rowing, you really must learn how to not let one bad stroke become 10 bad strokes which becomes a bad practice which can then lead to a bad race and a bad season. If you keep going down catastrophic paths when you mess up, you have taken yourself out of the game before it has even begun. Because we do workouts and pieces so often, we as a team have had to learn that you aren’t always going to have your best performance because you can’t be perfect every single time you get onto the erg or the water. But to keep moving in the right direction, you need to continue to grow from little failures and remember that they are an important part of the process. I did not realize this until I really struggled in rowing, but I also know that without that struggle, I would not have the confidence and skills I do now. </p>

            <h3>Attidue is Everything</h3>
            <p>This year, our team started working with a leadership coach. This coach has been super beneficial to us, and I’ve loved hearing his techniques and advice for how we can function together as a team. One of the most important things that he taught us was the famous quote used in sports “Who’s got it better than us?” which is something that coaches will say to remind their players to be grateful and enjoy the work we do. This is extremely pertinent to rowing and especially at Syracuse. When we are outside rowing in 30-degree weather and its hailing and its 6am and you had a paper to write last night, you can always say “who’s got it better than us?” instead of complaining and usually your teammates will laugh, and the boat’s moral will improve. I think this quote embodies how important it is to remember your why, and remember that you get to do things, not just that you must do things. Having a positive attitude and being grateful for every practice stroke and race is so important, even if things seem like they suck. I’ve been trying to adopt this attitude into my daily life, and it has helped me live in the moment and be grateful for the things I get to do.</p>

            <h3>Comparison is the Enemy</h3>
            <p>On a D1 rowing team, you are constantly being compared. This can be as big as when the weekly rankings of colleges come out or as small as how fast you were one practice to the next. This comparison is difficult, especially as the ranking of rowing is extremely clear cut. Your top 8 athletes go in the varsity 8, then then next 8 are in the 2v… and so on. And these rankings are obvious, every single time we show up for practice to know what boat we are in, everyone’s name is written down for everyone to see. While this comparison can be difficult, learning how to deal with it has been invaluable to me.
                For example, I had an objectively great freshman year. I was in a top boat and even got to compete at the NCAA championships. However, the next year, I struggled and failed time after time. I dropped down 2 boats and just could not pull myself out of the struggle. This challenging time turned into an entire challenging year because I was constantly comparing myself to the year prior. If I wasn’t placed in the boat, I was in the year before I would freak out instead of looking at every practice like an opportunity. I was constantly catastrophizing, comparing myself to others and ultimately speaking negatively about myself. This lasted an entire year before I was able to pull myself out of my slump and just focus on myself. It is so hard to stop comparing yourself to others and most people still do but through rowing, I have worked on catching myself before the comparisons start to inhibit my ability to perform.
