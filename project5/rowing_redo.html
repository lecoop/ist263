    <h1>Learn more about what rowing and collegiate athletics means to me</h1>
    <p>Rowing is such a big part of my life that it deserves its own page. Here I will walk you through my journey to becoming a college athlete, what a typical day of my life is like, and all the things rowing has taught me that are invaluable to my development as a person.</p>

    <h3>How I got to Syracuse Women's Rowing</h2>
    <p>I played basketball for 10 years before I ever picked up an oar. However, after a poor experience with my high-school basketball coach, I was inspired to try rowing and am eternally grateful that I did. During my junior year of high school after only 2 years of rowing, I was recruited to row at the top 10 rowing school, Syracuse! Rowing has made me into the person I am today and has taught me so many life lessons that I donâ€™t feel listing it on my resume encapsulates. Hence, here are just some of the wonderful things that rowing has taught me and continues to enforce each day.</p>
