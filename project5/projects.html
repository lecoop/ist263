<h1>Dive deeper into some projects I've worked on</h1>
<div class="projects">
    <div><h2>Research Consultant for the Prevention Network of CNY:</h2>
        <p>Overview: I worked as a research consultant to analyze data regarding substance abuse in Lewis County, NY. I created a 30-page report and presented it to the data analysis team at the Prevention Network. My most interesting finding was that youth in Lewis County, NY were more susceptible to drug abuse than alcohol abuse in 2021.</p>

    <div><h2>IST407 Final Project – NYC Car Crash Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>With a team of 5 peers, I worked on analyzing NYC car crash data to determine what whether conditions were likely to cause crashes within the city.</p>

    <div><h2>IST359 Final – Syracuse Women’s Rowing Database</h2>
        <p>I designed a database for the Syracuse University Women’s rowing team to properly store athlete’s data and access information more efficiently.</p>
        <object class="pdf" 
                    data=
        "../project/media/coop_final_assignment02_answertemplate.pdf"

                    height="500" alt="PDF of Syracuse Women's Rowing Database Assignment">
        </object></div>
        <div><h2>Student-Athlete Advisory Committee Community Outreach Chair</h2>
            <p>As chair I coordinated student-athlete participation in many community events within Syracuse, NY. My favorite event so far has been participating in Cuse Spot. I worked with a Professor at Syracuse to involve SAAC in Cuse Spot, which is a camp for local elementary school kids to participate in during their Feburary break. Student-Athletes were able to sign up for 2-hour shifts to teach students their sport, do art and do science experiments. This event was super impactful and was so important because it is held at a community center located in what once was Syracuse's 15th-ward, a historically black neighborhood that was destroyed and surrounding areas disadvantaged due to the construction of the major high-way 1-81.</p>
